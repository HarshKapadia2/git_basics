=== License

* An open source license protects contributors and users. Businesses and savvy developers won’t touch a project without this protection.
* link:https://opensource.guide/legal/#why-do-people-care-so-much-about-the-legal-side-of-open-source[The need for an open source license.]
* The license under which a project is released can be changed at any time.
* it’s hard to go wrong with the link:https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/[MIT license] as it’s short, very easy to understand and allows anyone to do anything so long as they keep a copy of the license, including the repository owner's copyright notice.
* A good place to choose a license is https://choosealicense.com/.
* A commonly used license can be added directly from the 'Community' tab in the 'Insights' section of a repository. If the license is not present in the license section, a file called `LICENSE` (without an extension) can be created and the content of the license can be pasted in it. (The contents can be found at https://choosealicense.com/.)

[WARNING]
====
If certain software doesn’t have a license, that generally means that there is no permission from the creators of the software to use, modify or share the software. Although a code host such as GitHub may allow viewing and forking the code, this does not imply that anyone is permitted to use, modify, or share the software for any purpose.

The options are

* Ask the maintainers nicely to add a license.
* Don’t use the software.
* Negotiate a private license with a lawyer.
