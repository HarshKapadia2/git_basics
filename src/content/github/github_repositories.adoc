* There are two types of repositories on GitHub (These are link:#_repositories_its_types[remote repos])
    ** Public repo
    ** Private repo

* *Public repo*
    ** A public repository is a repo open for the world to view, download and use (ethically or unethically, depending upon the [license]).
    ** Contributors can raise [issues] on the repo and make a [pull request (PR)] to it.
    ** Collaborators and the owner can raise [issues] on the repo and push code to it.
    ** It is a good way to improve the software and help others by showcasing the code and features as well!
    ** A GitHub free user is allowed to make unlimited public repos with unlimited collaborators. (There is a limit on the number of collaborators that can be added by the owner/organisation in 24 hours.)

* *Private repo*
    ** A private repo is only open for viewing, downloading and uploading for the collaborator that the repo owner chooses.
    ** A private repo will only have collaborators as contributors. Contributors can raise [issues] on the repo and make a [pull request (PR)] to it.
    ** Collaborators and the owner can raise [issues] on the repo and push code to it.
    ** This type of repo is usually used to work on a project with or without a team, privately.
    ** A GitHub free user is allowed to make unlimited private repos with unlimited collaborators. (There is a limit on the number of collaborators that can be added by the owner/organisation in 24 hours.)
