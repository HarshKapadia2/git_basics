=== The `.git` Directory

On executing the link:#_git_init[`git init` command] in a directory, Git creates a hidden `.git` directory in that directory. The `.git` directory contains all the project history data on which Git can perform its version control functions. It also contains files to configure the way Git handles things for that particular link:#_repository[repository].

==== The `index` File

* This file contains the details of link:#_added_files[staged (added) files] and is the staging area of the repository.

NOTE: The words 'index', 'stage' and 'cache' are the same in Git and are used interchangeably.

* It is created when files are added for the first time and is updated every time the link:#_git_add[`git add` command] is executed.

image::index-explained.png[alt="Index file explained", 400, 400]

* It is a binary file and just printing contents using `cat .git/index` will result in gibberish. Its contents can be accessed using the `git ls-files --stage` [plumbing command].

image::git-ls-files.png[alt="'git ls-files --stage' command", 600, 600]

* From the image above
	** `100644` is the mode of the file. It is an octal number.

		Octal: 100644
		Binary: 001000 000 110100100

		*** The first six binary bits indicate the object type.
			**** `001000` indicates a regular file. (As seen in this case.)
			**** `001010` indicates a link:https://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2016/02/20/symlinks-in-git[symlink (symbolic link)^].
			**** `001110` indicates a link:https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/version-control-with/9780596158187/ch15s04.html#:~:text=gitlink[gitlink^].
		*** The next three binary bits (`000`) are unused.
		*** The last nine binary bits (`110100100`) indicate link:https://harshkapadia2.github.io/cli/terminal.html#changing-permissions[Unix file permissions^].
			**** `644` and `755` are valid for regular files.
			**** Symlinks and gitlinks have the value `0` in this field.
	** The next 40 character hexadecimal string is the link:#_sha1[SHA-1 hash] of the file.
	** The next number is a stage number/slot, which is useful during merge conflict handling.
		*** `0` indicates a normal un-conflicted file.
		*** `1` indicates the base, i.e., the original version of the file.
		*** `2` indicates the 'ours' version, i.e., the HEAD version with both changes.
		*** `3` indicates the 'theirs' version, i.e., the file with the incoming changes.
	** The last string is the name of the file being referred to.
* link:https://mincong.io/2018/04/28/git-index[More on the `index` file contents.^]
* link:https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/2-The-Index/1-meet-the-middle-man.html[More on the `index` file usage.^]

==== The `HEAD` File

* It is used to refer to the latest commit in the current branch.
* Usually it does not contain a commit link:#_sha1[SHA-1], but contains the path to a file (of the name of the current branch) in the link:#_the_refs_directory[refs directory] which stores the last commit's SHA-1 hash in that branch.
* It contains a commit's SHA-1 hash when link:#_commits_sha[a specific commit or tag is checked out]. (link:#_detached_head[Detached HEAD] state.)
* link:#_head[More on the `HEAD` file.]
* Eg:

	# in the 'main' branch
	$ cat .git/HEAD
	ref: refs/heads/main
	$ git switch test_branch
	Switched to branch 'test_branch'
	$ cat .git/HEAD
	ref: refs/heads/test_branch

==== The `refs` Directory

```
.git
├───...
└───refs
    ├───heads
    │   └───<branch_name(s)>
    ├───remotes
    │   └───<remote_alias(es)>
    │       └───<branch_name(s)>
    ├───stash
    └───tags
        └───<tag_name(s)>
```

* This directory holds the reference to the latest commit in every local branch and fetched remote branch in the form of the SHA-1 hash of the commit.
* It also stores the SHA-1 hash of the commit which has been [tagged].
* The link:#_the_head_file[`HEAD` file] references a file (of the name of link:#_new_branch_name[the branch that is currently checked out]) from the `heads` directory in this (`refs`) directory.

==== The `packed-refs` File

* One file is created per branch and tag in the link:#_the_refs_directory[`refs` directory].
* In a repository with a lot of branches and tags, there is a huge number of refs and a lot of the refs and tags are not actively used/changed.
* These refs occupy a lot of storage space and cause performance issues.
* The `git pack-refs` command is used to solve this problem. It stores all the refs in a single file called `packed-refs`.

image::cat-packed-refs.png[alt="Print the packed-ref file", 600, 600]

* If a ref is missing from the usual `refs` directory after packing, it is looked up in this file and used if found.
* Subsequent updates to a packed branch ref creates a new file in the `refs` directory as usual.

==== The `logs` Directory

```
.git
├───...
└───logs
    ├───HEAD
    └───refs
        ├───heads
        │   └───<branch_name(s)>
        ├───remotes
        │   └───<remote_alias(es)>
        │       └───<branch_name(s)>
        └───stash
```

* Contains the history of all commits in order.

image::cat-logs.png[alt="Print a branch's log file", 1000, 1000]

* Every row consists of the parent commit's link:#_sha1[SHA-1 hash], the current commit's SHA-1 hash, the committer's name and e-mail, the link:https://www.epochconverter.com/#:~:text=What%20is%20epoch%20time[Unix Epoch Time^] of the commit, the time zone, the type of action and message in order.
* There are logs for every branch in the local Git repository and for the fetched branches from the remote Git repository/repositories (if any).
* Inside the `logs` directory
	** The `HEAD` file stores information about all the commands executed by the user, such as branch switches, commits, rebases, etc.
	** The files in the refs directory only include branch specific operations and history, such as commits, pulls, resets, rebases, etc.

==== The `FETCH_HEAD` file

* It contains the latest commits of the fetched remote branch(es).
* It corresponds to the branch which was
	** link:#_new_branch_name[Checked out] when last fetched.
		+++
		<br />
		<br />
		+++
		image:cat-FETCH_HEAD-1.png[alt="The contents of the FETCH_HEAD file", 800, 800]

		*** From the image above, only one branch is displayed without the `not-for-merge` text. The odd one out (the main branch in this case) is the branch which was checked out while fetching.
	** Explicitly mentioned using the link:#_git_fetch[`git fetch <remote_repo_alias> <branch_name>` command].

		image:cat-FETCH_HEAD-2.png[alt="The contents of the FETCH_HEAD file", 800, 800]

==== The `COMMIT_EDITMSG` File

* The commit message is written in this file.
* This file is opened in an editor on executing the link:#_git_commit[`git commit` command].
* It contains the output of the link:#_git_status[`git status` command] commented out using the `#` character.
* If there has been a commit before, then this file will show the last commit message along with the `git status` output just before that commit.

==== The `objects` Directory

```
.git
├───...
└───objects
    ├───<first_2_SHA-1_characters>
    │   └───<remaining_38_SHA-1_characters>
    ├───info
    └───pack
        ├───<*.idx>
        └───<*.pack>
```

* The most important directory in the `.git` directory.
* It houses the data (SHA-1 hashes) of all the link:#_internal_working_of_git[commit, tree and blob objects] in the repository.
* To decrease access time, objects are placed in buckets (directories), with the first two characters of their SHA-1 hash as the name of the bucket. The remaining 38 characters are used to name the object's file.
* link:#_the_pack_directory[More on the `pack` directory.]

==== The `info` Directory

```
.git
├───...
└───info
    └───exclude
```

* It contains the `exclude` file which behaves like the link:#_gitignore_file[`.gitignore` file], but is used to ignore files locally without modifying `.gitignore`.
* link:#_ignore_files_locally_without_modifying_gitignore[More on the `exclude` file.]

==== The `config` File

* This file contains the local Git repository configuration.
* It can be modified using the link:#_git_config[`git config --local` command].

==== The `addp-hunk-edit.diff` File

* Created when the `e` (edit) option is chosen in the link:#_p_or_patch[`git add --patch` command].
* Enables the manual edit of a hunk of a file to be link:#_added_files[staged].

==== The `ORIG_HEAD` File

* It contains the SHA-1 hash of a commit.
* It is the previous state of the HEAD, but not necessarily the immediate previous state.
* It is set by certain commands which have destructive/dangerous behaviour, so it usually points to the latest commit with a destructive change.
* It is less useful now because of the [`git reflog` command] which makes reverting/resetting to a particular commit easier.

==== The `description` File

* This is the description of the repository.
* This file is used by link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-GitWeb[GitWeb^], which hardly anyone uses today, so can be left alone.
