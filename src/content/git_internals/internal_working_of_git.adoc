=== Internal Working of Git

TIP: It is recommended to go through this section only if the reader has some experience with Git. Absolute beginners do not need to know this.

Some part of the internal working of Git will be explored through an example in this section. A Windows operating system with Git Bash is being used for this example. (Certain Unix commands work with Git Bash.)

Run `git init` to initialize an empty Git [repo] in the `inside_git` directory (root directory). An empty hidden directory `.git` is created in the root folder.

image::git-init.jpg[alt="Git Init", 600, 600]

The command `du -c` is used to list the sub-directories of the root directory `inside_git` and the size (in kbs) of each sub-directory.

image::du-c-1.jpg[alt="Du -c", 600, 600]

==== Blob Object

Create a new file in the root folder.

image::touch-master_file_1.jpg[alt="Create new file", 600, 600]

Now the root directory contains the `.git` directory and the new file `master_file_1.txt`.

image::ls-a-1.jpg[alt="Master File", 600, 600]

Add the file to the [staging area] using [`git add .`] and run `du -c` once again.

image::du-c-2.jpg[alt="Stage file", 600, 600]

Note that a new directory `e6` has been added to `./.git/objects`.

Use the `dir` (or `ls`) command to find out which file is present in the dir `./.git/objects/e6`.

image::dir-1.jpg[alt="Create new directory", 600, 600]

[.word-break-all]
The file name `9de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391` has 38 characters. On combining it with the folder name (`e6`) at the start, it becomes a 40 character string `e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391`. This is a [SHA1] (Secure Hashing Algorithm 1) hash. Git encodes the content of the file (and more - more on that soon) in this hash. Every add and commit produces its own unique SHA1 hash(es). The first two characters of the hash are used for bucketing the hashes into folders by Git. The case of two hashes colliding is very rare. *Git uses 4 to 8 characters to refer to a commit in short.*

Now as mentioned in the previous paragraph, Git stores the contents of the file and other details in the hash. To check that out, some content needs to be added to the file. The file will then have to be added again (this will produce another hash).

image::add-to-master_file_1-1.jpg[alt="Add to Master file", 600, 600]
image::edit-master_file_1-1.jpg[alt="Edit master file", 600, 600]

[.word-break-all]
From the last command in the above picture, it can be inferred that a new hash `1a3851c172420a2198cf8ca6f2b776589d955cc5` was generated.

Now check its contents using the `cat` command.

image::cat-1.jpg[alt="Check contents", 600, 600]

Oops! That's gibberish! So was what was said above a lie? No. Git actually compresses files with the https://www.zlib.net/[zlib^] library and then hashes them. So to make sense of the hash, it needs to be de-compressed.

image::de-compressed.jpg[alt="Decompress", 600, 600]

`blob 16Git is amazing!` is the content of the hashed file in Git.

Breaking it down:

* *`blob`* is the file type. It is an abbreviation for 'binary large object'.
+
Files can be of three types in Git:

    ** Blob object
    ** Commit object
    ** Tree object

+
More on `commit` and `tree` objects soon.

* `16` is the file size (length). `Git is amazing!` consists of 15 characters, but Git adds a null character (`\0`) before the data, making the length 16.
* `Git is amazing!` is the file data that was originally entered.

[NOTE.word-break-all]
====
If `blob 16\0Git is amazing!` is hashed using SHA1, the same hash (`1a3851c172420a2198cf8ca6f2b776589d955cc5`) will be generated!
====

The process of finding the contents of the file using `cat` is pretty cumbersome. It is a better idea to use the [plumbing commands] provided by Git.

Some of the plumbing commands that are needed:

* `git cat-file -p <hash>` (-p = pretty print) to display file data.
* `git cat-file -t <hash>` (-t = type) to display file type (blob, commit or tree).
* `git cat-file -s <hash>` (-s = size) to display the file size (length).

==== Commit and Tree Objects

Commit `master_file_1.txt` using [`git commit`] and then run `du -c` again.

image::commit-master_file_1-1.jpg[alt="Commit master file", 600, 600]

From the above picture it can be noticed that two new directories `./.git/objects/1b` and `./.git/objects/d5` were created. Also, after committing the file, Git gives the first 7 characters of the SHA1 for that commit.

Check the file type using the plumbing commands.

image::cat-file-t-1.jpg[alt="Plumbing commands", 600, 600]

So the file type is `commit`, inferring that it is a file generated through a commit.

Now check the content of the *commit file*.

image::cat-file-p-1.jpg[alt="Commit", 600, 600]

Breaking down the output:

[.word-break-all]
* `tree 1b2190cdc2801ec3df6505dc351dee878ac7f2fc` is the other SHA1 hash that was generated (remember that two files were generated in `./.git/objects` on committing the file), of the type `tree`. The tree is the [snapshot] of the current state of the local repository. The contents of the tree file will be looked into soon.
* Parent commit's SHA1 hash (not present here - will be looked into in the `Adding another file (parent commit)` section below.)
* The next line has the details of the author (the one who wrote the code):
    ** Name
    ** e-mail ID
    ** Timestamp
* The next line has the details of the committer (the one who pushed the code):
    ** Name
    ** e-mail ID
    ** Timestamp
* A blank line
* Commit message
* Commit description (if provided) (not present here)

Now check the contents of the *tree file*. (Take the hash from the commit file contents.)

image::cat-file-p-2.jpg[alt="Check contents", 600, 600]

*The tree file has entries of the files & directories in the snapshot (current state) of the local repository.*

The format of each line is the same.

[.word-break-all]
Have a look at `100644 blob 1a3851c172420a2198cf8ca6f2b776589d955cc5 master_file_1.txt`:

* `100644` is the mode, which is some sort of unix-style file permission and file type checking system.
* `blob` is the file type. (It can be a `tree` object as well - covered in the `Creating a directory` section below.)

[.word-break-all]
* `1a3851c172420a2198cf8ca6f2b776589d955cc5` is the latest SHA1 hash of the added file. It is the same as the hash generated while adding the file to the staging area. This hash can be of a blob (like in this case) or a tree file (looked into in the `Creating a directory` section below).
* Name of the file.

Take a look at the connections between the commit, tree and blob files.

image::connection-graph-1.png[alt="Connection graph", 600, 600]

NOTE: The blob `e69de` has been modified to blob `1a385` and so is not connected to the tree `1b219`. Only the latest blob of every added file is connected to the new tree object when a commit is made.

==== Adding Another File (Parent Commit)

Create another file (`master_file_2.txt`), add it to Git and commit it.

image::touch-master_file_2.jpg[alt="Create master file", 600, 600]

Just like what was done before, check the contents of the commit file (using part of the hash `8282663` as seen in the above picture).

image::cat-file-p-3.jpg[alt="Create another master file", 600, 600]

[.word-break-all]
A new line `parent d5b8f77ce1dc1a37b29885026055c8656c3e0b65` is seen. Remember, this is the hash of the previous commit. *So Git is creating a graph.* (A picture is provided below.) Also, the [`HEAD`] will now automatically point to this (latest - `82826`) commit rather than the parent (previous - `d5b8f`) commit as it was doing before. To verify, have a look at where the `HEAD` is pointing.

image::head-1.jpg[alt="HEAD", 600, 600]

It is pointing to the latest commit (`82826`).

Now check the contents of the tree object of the latest commit.

image::cat-file-p-4.jpg[alt="Contents of tree", 600, 600]

Take a look at the new graph of the repository.

image::connection-graph-2.png[alt="Connection graph", 600, 600]

==== Creating a Directory

Create a new file (`master_dir_1_file_3.txt`) inside a a directory (`dir_1`), add it, commit it and look at the contents of the commit file.

image::mkdir_1.jpg[alt="Create new file in directory", 600, 600]

The commit file has the same format as before.

Now have a look at the contents of the tree file (with SHA1 hash `f6a65` as seen in the above picture).

image::cat-file-p-5.jpg[alt="Contents of tree", 600, 600]

It is surprising to note that the tree `f6a65` points to another tree `abecf`! The name of the new tree is `dir_1`.

Now have a look at the contents of the `dir_1` tree.

image::cat-file-p-6.jpg[alt="Contents of directory tree", 600, 600]

So it points to the file (`master_dir_1_file_3.txt`) inside the directory `dir_1`.

Have a look at how the tree connected itself to the blobs.

image::tree-1.png[alt="Tree", 600, 600]

Also have a look at the new graph of the entire repository.

image::connection-graph-3.png[alt="Connection Graph", 600, 600]

==== Renaming a File

Rename `master_file_1.txt` to `the_master_file.txt` to see how Git handles it internally.

image::mv-1.jpg[alt="Rename file", 600, 600]

image::add-1.jpg[alt="Stage", 600, 600]

When the file is committed, Git is smart enough to recognize that a file was renamed and is not a new file, as can be seen in the last line of the above picture. It can recognize this because the SHA1 hash of the file has not changed (as the content of the file has not changed).

Now check the contents of the commit and tree files.

image::cat-file-p-7.jpg[alt="Contents of commit", 600, 600]

Take a look at the last line. The hash `1a385` is same as the hash of the original file name (`master_file_1.txt`) (scroll up and check) and *just the name of the file has been changed in the tree object by Git instead of creating a new blob file. This is efficient space management by Git!*

Take a look at the structure of the repo.

image::connection-graph-4.png[alt="Connection Graph", 600, 600]

==== Making Changes to Huge Files

Add and commit a picture to Git. The size of the picture is 1.374 Mb (or 1374 kb), so it is a relatively huge file as compared to the other files (~ 1 kb).

image::add-2.jpg[alt="Stage", 600, 600]

image::cat-file-p-8.jpg[alt="Commit", 600, 600]

Now make a small change to the png file contents (append a `.` to the file contents) and then add and commit it again.

image::add-3.jpg[alt="Stage and commit", 600, 600]

On comparing the SHA1 hashes of `master_picture_1.png` in the latest (`6d2d2`) and previous (`27666`) tree, we can make out that they are *different*. So Git has created two different blobs (`ca893` and `1f7af`) for the same file, even when they only have a very small difference.

Run `du -c` now.

image::du-c-3.jpg[alt="Du -c", 600, 600]

As it can be seen, there are two directories (`./.git/objects/1f` and `./.git/objects/ca`) with the same size (1376 kb).

NOTE: The directory content size (1376 kb) is greater than the picture size (1374 kb) as Git adds the file type and size (length) to the blob file and then hashes it.

So is Git inefficient at handling huge files? No. The content of the file has changed and this produces a different SHA1 hash (`1f7af`) than the original SHA1 hash (`ca893`) and so Git is not able to handle the change like it did when a file was simply renamed. Having multiple copies of such a huge file is not a problem in the local storage, but it will take up a lot of bandwidth while [pushing] and [pulling] from a platform like [GitHub]. So to avoid this, Git uses *Delta compression*. It uses the difference (`diff.` in short) of one of the files and indicates the other as the parent. This is looked into in the `Pack file` section below.

==== Pack File

*Delta compression* is carried out when the user pushes/pulls code to/from GitHub and when an aggressive garbage collection (`git gc --aggressive`) is carried out.

Delta compression creates two files in `./.git/objects/pack`:

* A pack file (.pack)
* An index file (.idx)

They will be talked about soon.

Take a view of the current state of the repo.

image::du-c-3.jpg[alt="Du -c", 600, 600]

Note the size of `./.git/objects/pack` in the above picture (0 kb).

Aggressive garbage collection will be used to carry out Delta compression and then `du -c` to view the changes.

image::du-c-4.jpg[alt="Du -c", 600, 600]

NOTE: The total size of the `.git` directory went down from 4220kb (seen in the first `du -c` picture in this sub-section) to 2838kb (as seen in the above picture). This is a 32.75% reduction in the size of the local repository!

Notice in the above picture that the size of `./.git/objects/pack` is 1380 kb and a lot of the files in `./.git/objects` have disappeared, except for `./.git/objects/e6`.

All of this will be looked into, one by one.

* Look at the contents of `./.git/objects/pack`.

+
image::dir-2.jpg[alt="Content of directory", 600, 600]
+
As mentioned above, two files (a pack file `.pack` and an index file `.idx`) are created.
+
Have a look at the contents of both the files using the plumbing command `git verify-pack -v path/to/pack/file/<file_name>.pack` (-v = verbose). (Works with `.idx` as well.)
+
image::verify-pack-1.jpg[alt="Contents of files", 600, 600]
+
*The pack file is a single file containing the contents of all the objects that were removed from the file system.*
+
Have a look at the hash `1f7af` (the blob of the modified picture). Its size is very large as compared to the others. Now look at the the hash `ca893` (the blob of the original picture). It is very small in size and it has the hash of the modified picture (`1f7af`) mentioned after it, indicating that its (ie, the original picture's) parent is the modified file. *Thus, Git stored the diff for one of the files rather than the entire file twice, making it space efficient!*

NOTE: https://gist.github.com/matthewmccullough/2695758[Similar example^].

NOTE: *The pack file has a graph in it, just like the commit, tree and blob files have one!*

NOTE: The `.idx` (index) file stores the same content as the `.pack` file and is a file that *contains offsets into the pack file so you can quickly seek to a specific object*.

* Now look into the `./.git/objects` directory.

+
On running the aggressive garbage collection, Git got rid of all the files *that were related to commits* and added them to the pack file.

NOTE: On pushing and/or pulling, these files are not deleted, just a pack file and an index file are generated.

* The `./.git/objects/e6` directory did not get removed as it was not related (connected) to any tree object.

Finally, take a look at the log of the repository.
