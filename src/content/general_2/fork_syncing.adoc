=== Sync a Fork with its Original Repo

* Once a repository (repo) is [forked], the forked repo does not receive the latest commits in the original repo.

* To get those new changes, the forked repo has to be synced with the original repo.

[NOTE]
====
* GitHub has now made syncing a [forked repo] with its original repo very easy.

* The GUI has buttons to directly do it (as shown in the image below, Fetch upstream -> Fetch and merge). The changes in the synced forked repo only have to be link:#_git_pull[pulled] to reflect locally.

* The steps below will still work, but are unnecessary for repositories on GitHub.

* Steps to be followed

    ** Connect the link:#_repositories_its_types/:~:text=local%20repo[local] forked repo with the original link:link:#_repositories_its_types/:~:text=remote%20repo[remote] repo.

        *** Run link:#_git_remote/:~:text=-v[`git remote -v`] to list all the remote repos connected to the local forked repo.

        *** Add the original (remote) repo as a remote to the local forked repo using link:#_git_remote/:~:text=add%20<remote_repo_alias>%20<remote_repo_url>.git[`git remote add originalRepo <link_to_original_repo>.git`].

            **** The link:#_aliases/:~:text=An%20alias%20can%20be%20given%20to%20the%20remote%20repo[alias] for the original remote repo is assumed to be `originalRepo` here.

        *** Run link:#_git_remote/:~:text=-v[`git remote -v`] again to check whether it has been added.

        *** The original repo is now connected to the local forked repo.

    ** Get the latest changes in the original repo and push the to your forked (remote) repo.

        *** Run link:#_git_pull[`git pull originalRepo <branch_name>`] to get the latest changes from the original repo.

            **** If there are link:#_merge_conflicts[merge conflicts], they have to be handled.

        *** Push the changes to the remote forked repo using link:#_git_push[`git push -u origin <branch_name>`].

            **** The link:#_aliases/:~:text=An%20alias%20can%20be%20given%20to%20the%20remote%20repo[alias] for the remote forked repo is assumed to be `origin` here.

NOTE: The `git pull` step can be split into `git fetch` & `git merge` as well.

* Summary of the important commands to sync a fork

```
git remote add originalRepo <link_to_original_repo>.git
git pull originalRepo <branch_name>
git push -u origin <branch_name>
```

(where `originalRepo` = original remote repo alias & `origin` = remote forked repo alias)
