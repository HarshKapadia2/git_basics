=== Checkout a Remote Branch

There can be a situation in which a branch exists on the remote repo, but not in the local repo.

.Two branches in the remote repository

.Only one branch in the local repository

* In such a situation, the remote branch needs to be link:#_description_11[fetched] locally and then link:#_git_checkout[checked out] to be used locally.

* There are two possibilities
	** The remote branch has already been fetched locally, but not checked out.
	** The remote branch has not been fetched.

* To check whether the remote branch has been fetched locally or not, run link:#_a[`git branch -a`]. *If the branch is listed in red, then it has been fetched locally.*

==== If the Branch has been Fetched Locally

* Run `git checkout <fetched_branch_name>` or `git switch <fetched_branch_name>` to switch to the fetched remote branch.

.Successfully switched to 'br_1'!

==== If the Branch has not been Fetched Locally

.'br_1' has been not been fetched (not in list)

* Run `git checkout <fetched_branch_name>` or `git switch <fetched_branch_name>` to switch to the fetched remote branch.
