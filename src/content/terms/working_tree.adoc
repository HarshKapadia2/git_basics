=== Working Tree

* It notes the untracked files in the working directory/copy - a copy of the most recent state of the files a person is working on.
* Any changes to files will be marked and seen in the Working Tree.
* Here if a person make changes and does not explicitly save them to git, he will lose the changes made to the files.
* If one make changes to files in the working tree git will recognize that are modified, but until he tells git “Hey pay attention to these files,” it won’t save anything that goes on in them.
