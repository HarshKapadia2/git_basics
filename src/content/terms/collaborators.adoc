=== Collaborators

* Collaborators are the link:#_repository[repository (repo)] owner's team members/partners.
* A collaborator has a lot of accesses that a repo owner has. 
* They can directly push to the repository, merge PRs, etc.
* The owner of the repo can invite any number of collaborator from the `settings/manage access` section in the repo (there is a limit to the number of invites in 24 hrs).

NOTE: A link:#_contributors[contributor] is a collaborator only if he is chosen to be a collaborator by the owner. So a collaborator is a contributor, but the vice versa is not always true.
