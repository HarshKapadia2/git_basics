=== HEAD

* HEAD is a reference to the latest commit in the current link:#_branches[branch].
* When a commit is made, Git automatically sets the HEAD to the latest commit.

NOTE: HEAD is contextual. It will point to the latest commit in the current branch.

* To check where the current HEAD is pointing, run `cat .git/HEAD` in the root directory.
	** Eg:

		# in the 'main' branch
		$ cat .git/HEAD
		ref: refs/heads/main
		$ git switch test_branch
		Switched to branch 'test_branch'
		$ cat .git/HEAD
		ref: refs/heads/test_branch

[#_detached_head]
* When the HEAD points to a commit that is not the latest commit in a branch, that is a *detached HEAD*. A specific commit can be referred to, using link:#_git_checkout[`git checkout`].
