=== HEAD

* HEAD is a reference to the latest commit in the current link:#_branches[branch].
* When a commit is made, Git automatically sets the HEAD to the latest commit.

NOTE: HEAD is contextual. It will point to the latest commit in the current branch.

* To check where the current HEAD is pointing, use `cat .git/HEAD`.

** Eg:

 # in the master branch
 $ cat .git/HEAD
 # output
 ref: refs/heads/master

 git checkout test_branch
 # switched to test branch
 $ git .git/HEAD
 # output
 ref: refs/heads/test_branch

* When the HEAD points to a commit that is not the latest commit in a branch, that is a *detached HEAD*. A specific commit can be referred to, using link:#_git_checkout[`git checkout`].
