=== Aliases

[quote, Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases]
[Aliases] make your Git experience simpler, easier, and more familiar...

* If you don’t want to type the entire text of each of the Git commands, you can easily set up an alias for each command using `git config`. Here are a couple of examples you may want to set up:
+
 git config --global alias.co checkout
 git config --global alias.br branch
 git config --global alias.ci commit
 git config --global alias.st status
+
This means that, for example, instead of typing `git commit`, you just need to type `git ci`. As you go on using Git, you’ll probably use other commands frequently as well; don’t hesitate to create new aliases.

* An alias can be given to the remote link:#_repository[repo] as well, to make pulling and pushing easier.
    ** You can set custom aliases if you add a remote (ie, remote repo) using link:#_git_remote[`git remote`].
    ** If you clone a repo using link:#_git_clone[`git clone`], the default alias of the remote repo is `origin`.
