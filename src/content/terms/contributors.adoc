=== Contributors

* Contributors are people who contribute to link:#_repository[repositories] to make them better.

NOTE: A contributor is a link:#_collaborators[collaborator] only if he is chosen to be a collaborator by the owner. So a collaborator is a contributor, but the vice versa is not always true.

==== General contributor instructions

* [Fork] the repo.
* link:#_git_clone[clone] the forked repo locally.
* Work on the contribution(s) according to the [issues] and/or [`CONTRIBUTING.md`].

TIP: Follow correct link:#_git_commit[commit message] structure. Eg: `:bug: fix: Login button position corrected (#26, #32, #33)`

* link:#_git_push[Push] the code to the forked repo.
* Make a [pull request (PR)]!
