=== Issues

* Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. link:#_what_is_github[GitHub’s] tracker is called 'Issues', and has its own section in every repository.
* Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for projects. They’re kind of like e-mail, except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of the team.
* If the link:#_github_repositories[repository is public], then anyone can raise an issue.
* Labels
    ** Issues have colour coded labels that help categorize and filter issues.
    ** Every issue can have multiple labels that can be modified at any time.
    ** Some labels are provided by GitHub and they can be custom created as well.
    ** Labels for new/beginner contributors:
        *** good-first-issue
        *** link:#_resources/:~:text=first%20timers%20only[first-timers-only]
* Issues and pull requests (PRs) can be referred to using `#`. Every issue and pull request has a number associated with it (usually mentioned at the top of the issue/PR, beside the title.) So `#69` or `#420` are examples of how issues/PRs can be referred to, in commit messages, PRs or issues.
