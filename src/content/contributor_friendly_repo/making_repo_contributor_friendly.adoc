Open source is all about opening up projects for the community to use and contribute to! Contributions are a very important aspect of open source. Contributions help the community in improving software/projects that they use, for themselves and others.

To make contributions easier, the following files/tools are used in a repository

* link:#_readme_md[`README.md`]
* link:#_contributing_md[`CONTRIBUTING.md`]
* link:#_license[`LICENSE`]
* link:#_code_of_conduct[`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`]
* link:#_issues[Issues]

They are discussed below.

TIP: A good place to get to know how a repository compares with the recommended community standards and add the missing files is the 'Community' tab in the 'Insights' section of a repository.
