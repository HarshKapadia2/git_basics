=== CONTRIBUTING.md

* The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file explains how a contributor should do things like format code, test fixes, and submit patches. It can also include instructions for contributors to set up a local environment.
* `md` stands for 'Markdown', which is a lightweight and very easy to learn markup language to create rich text using a plain text editor.
