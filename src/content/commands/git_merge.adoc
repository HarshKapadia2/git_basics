=== git merge

==== Command

`git merge <branch_name>`

==== Prerequisites

The following terms are required to be understood:

* link:#_head[HEAD]
* link:#_branches[Branches]

==== Description

The `git merge` command's primary responsibility is to combine separate branches and resolve any conflicting edits.

Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again.

The `git merge` command lets you take the independent lines of development created by link:#_git_branch[`git branch`] or link:#_git_checkout[`git checkout`] and integrate them into a single branch.

Preparing to merge:

    * Make sure to be in the branch (`link:#_git_checkout[git checkout] <receiving_ranch>`) you want to merge another branch into (let this branch be called `receiving_branch`).
    * Make sure the receiving branch and the merging branch are up-to-date with the latest remote changes.
    * Merge using `git merge <merging_branch>`
    * Eg: If you want to merge the 'feature' branch into the 'master' branch, run `git checkout master` (if you aren't already in the master branch, ie, if your HEAD points to another branch) and then run `git merge feature`.

NOTE: This *does not* create a new commit signifying the merge.

NOTE: The branch can be safely deleted.
    
Merges are of mainly two types:

    * Fast forward merges (usually for small and short develop-duration features)
    * Three way merges (usually for long ranging tasks and features)

NOTE: link:#_git_push[`git push`] is allowed only if you have a fast forward merge.

NOTE: link:#_merge_conflicts[Managing *merge conflicts* (using both CLIs and GUIs)].

==== Options/Flags

===== --abort

* This will exit from the merge process and return the branch to the state before the merge began.

===== --no-ff <merging_branch_name>

* If a fast forward merge is to be carried out, but even then create a new merge commit for the symbolic merging, this flag & option can be used.
* The text editor will open for a message. Save the merge message and close the file in the editor to complete the merge.

NOTE: This is useful for documenting all merges that occur in a repository, as a merge without this flag does not create a new commit.
