=== git add

==== Command

`git add <flags> <file_name.ext>` where `ext`stands for the extension of the file.

==== Prerequisites

The following terms are required to be understood:

* link:#_untracked_files[Untracked files]
* link:#_added_files[Added files]
* link:#_modified_files[Modified files]
* link:#_gitignore_file[.gitignore file]
* link:#_staging_staging_areaindex[Staging (staging area/index)]
* link:#_working_tree[Working tree]

==== Description

To add files to the staging area (refer to picture above).

==== Options/Flags

===== <file_name.ext>

* Adds a single file to the staging area.
* If file is located in a folder, use `directory_name/<file_name.ext>`
* Multiple file names in one command are allowed with a whitespace in between them.
* Eg: `git add dir/dir1_file.txt`

===== *.ext

* All files with '.ext' extension will be added to the staging area (except for the file names in the .gitignore file).

===== . (period)

* Eg: `git add .`
* Recursive command to send all untracked and modified files to the staging area (except for the file names in the .gitignore file).

===== -p or --patch

* Enables choosing the staging of specific hunks (group of lines/chunks) of files instead of entire files.
* It presents the diff between the index (staging area) and the working tree file and asks what one wants to do with the change of each hunk.
* Using this flag makes Git display hunks one by one and bring up command options for every hunk to
	** `y` (yes): Stage the hunk.
	** `n` (no): Not stage the hunk.
	** `q` (quit): Quit the process and not stage the current hunk or the **remaining** ones. (Hunks in order can be left undecided temporarily as seen in the options below.)
	** `a` (all): Stage the current hunk all the ones that follow.
	** `d` (delete): Not stage the current hunk all the ones that **follow**.
	** `g` (goto): Go to a particular hunk. (It will display a list with a hunk number to go to a particular hunk if there are more than 1 hunks.)
	** `/`: Search for a hunk matching the given regex.
	** `j`: Leave the current hunk undecided and see the next undecided hunk.
	** `J`: Leave the current hunk undecided and see the next hunk.
	** `k`: Leave the current hunk undecided and see the previous undecided hunk.
	** `K`: Leave the current hunk undecided and see the previous hunk.
	** `s` (split): Split the current hunk into smaller hunks.
	** `e` (edit): Manually edit the current hunk in an editor.
	** `?`: Print help.
* Eg: `git add -p` or `git add -p <file_name.ext>`

===== -n .

* Eg: `git add -n .`
* Shows files that will be added, but does not add them.
* Run other `git add` commands to actually add files to the staging area.

===== -u

* Stages modified and deleted files, without including new (untracked) files.
