=== git push

==== Command

`git push -u <remote_repo_alias> <remote_branch_name>`

==== Prerequisites

The following terms are required to be understood:

* link:#_aliases[Aliases]
* link:#_repository[Repository (repo)]
* link:#_branches[Branches]

==== Description

This command is used to transfer files from the local repo to the remote repo.

To set up a remote repo, refer to link:#_git_remote[`git remote`] and [`creating a repo on GitHub`].

WARNING: If the push is to a newly created empty repository on GitHub, the link:#_main_vs_master_2[`main` vs `master` default branch issue] might cause it to fail.

NOTE: From the two pictures above, it can be inferred that Git will allow pushing only if the push results in a fast-forward merge.
