==== Options/Flags

===== <new_branch_name>

* Switches to / views / checks out a branch with the name `new_branch_name`.
* Eg: `git checkout feature_branch`

NOTE: link:#_git_switch[`git switch`] can also be used to achieve the same result.

===== -b <new_branch_name>

* Creates a new branch & checks it out (switches to it) as well.

NOTE: The new branch is created from the curent HEAD.

===== -b <new_branch_name> <existing_branch_name>

* Creates a new branch & checks it out (switches to it) as well.

NOTE: The new branch is created from the last commit of the `existing_branch_name`.

===== <commit's_SHA>

* You can checkout a specific commit.

NOTE: This condition will land you in a link:#_head[detached HEAD] state.

===== <file_name.ext>

* To replace a modified file in the working directory/copy with the added/committed state version of that file.
* If there are no staged changes, then the copy of the file in the local link:#_repository[repository] is used, otherwise the current file is overwritten by the staged copy of the file.

NOTE: link:#_git_restore[`git restore`] can also be used to achieve the same result.
