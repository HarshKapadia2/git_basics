=== git commit

==== Command

`git commit <flags_&_options>`

==== Prequisites

The following terms are required to be understood:

* link:index.html#_staging_staging_areaindex[Staging (staging area/index)]
* link:index.html#_sha1[SHA1]
* link:index.html#_head[HEAD]

==== Description

A commit is simply a checkpoint telling Git to track all changes that have occurred up to the current point using the last commit as a comparison.

A commit is carried out only if there are files in the staging area, so make sure to run link:index.html#_git_add[`git add`] before this command.

Every commit has a *commit message* associated with it which describes the overall change made.

TIP: Short, crisp and to-the-point commit messages are preferred (<50 characters).

TIP: Use the imperative, present tense (eg: 'change', not 'changed' or 'changes') in commit messages, to be consistent with generated messages from commands like `git merge`. Eg: `git commit -m "Update README.md"`

If extra information is needed to be given, add it to the *description* of the commit.

Every commit has a unique *SHA1* associated with it.

Use link:index.html#_git_log[`git log`] & link:index.html#_git_show[`git show`] commands to get information on commits. 

IMPORTANT: Always link:index.html#_git_pull[pull] before committing & pushing.

TIP: Commit _related_ changes.

TIP: Commit changes frequently. This makes it easier to revert back to older versions to correct mistakes.

TIP: _Don't_ commit half-done or incomplete work.

==== Options/Flags

===== No option

* Just running `git commit` will launch a text editor prompting you for a commit message.
* After you’ve entered a message, save the file and close the editor using `:wq` or just save and exit the editor to create the actual commit.

===== -m "<commit_msg>"

* Avoids opening a text editor by providing the commit message in the Command Prompt, Terminal, Powershell, etc...

===== -m "<commit_message>" -m "<commit_description>"

* Enter the commit message and commit description if needed.

===== -a or --all

* Automatically stages files that have been modified or deleted, but untracked files are not affected.
* Eg: `git commit -a -m "<commit_message>" -m "<commit_description>"`

===== -m "Add only_this_file.ext from all staged files" only_this_file.ext

* Partially commiting staged changes

===== git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD

* This command shows all files within your git repo that it’s tracking.
